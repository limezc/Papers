# Papers

This project is designed to crawl academic papers from conferences such as CVPR. We collect and organize related paper codes and article links, making it easier for researchers and developers to access and utilize these resources.

## Features

- **Paper Crawling**: Our crawler regularly fetches the latest papers from conferences like CVPR.
- **Code Collection**: For papers with open-source implementations, we collect their code links for readers to view and use directly.
- **Article Links**: We provide direct links to each paper, allowing you to read the original text directly.
- **Paper Classification**: We categorize the papers, so you can quickly find the papers you need based on your interests and requirements.
- **Abstracts in English and Chinese**: We provide abstracts of each paper in both English and Chinese, helping you quickly understand the main content and contributions of the papers.
